<h2>Cleaning AI refers to artificial intelligence technologies 
    designed to assist with or automate cleaning tasks. This can 
    include robotic vacuum cleaners, smart home systems that manage 
    cleaning schedules, and software that optimizes cleaning routes and
     processes. These technologies often use sensors, machine learning,
      and data analytics to improve efficiency, reduce labor, and 
      enhance cleaning effectiveness in various environments, from 
      homes to industrial spaces. Overall, cleaning AI aims to simplify
       and enhance cleaning tasks, making them more efficient and less
        time-consuming.</h2>
